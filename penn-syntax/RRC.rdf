			Constituents correspond to a GOLD SyntacticConstruction:
			SyntacticConstruction is the class of grammar units that 
			have syntactic structure, i.e., consisting of more than 
			one syntactic word or construction in a syntactic 
			configuration. [Crystal 1980, 85-86]. 
			(http://www.linguistics-ontology.org/gold/2008)

			Corresponds to units of annotation in the EAGLES recommendations for syntactic annotation

			Traditionally sentences are deemed to be composed of major constituents 
			known as clauses, which may be main clauses (not included in a superordinate 
			clause) or embedded clauses (included in a superordinate clause) such as 
			relative clauses or adverbial clauses. A main clause, unless it is coordinated, 
			is equivalent to a simple sentence, and does not need to be separately labelled. 
			Embedded and coordinated clauses, on the other hand, will need to be separately 
			identified. We recommend that such units be identified in the annotation, and 
			labelled either as sentences (S) or as clauses (CL), according to the preference 
			specified in the annotation scheme.

			The reason for allowing choice here is that different theoretical preferences 
			have to be accommodated. In some syntactic models, the `clause' category is not 
			used (except informally), embedded clauses being marked by included [S] 
			constituents. In other models, clauses are identified as such, even where they 
			are coextensive with an independent sentence.

			One solution which commends itself (and is employed in the Lancaster Treebank and 
			the SUSANNE Corpus) is to retain [S ... S] as the delimiter of sentences, whether 
			included or not, and also to use [S ... S] for the coordinated parts of a compound 
			sentence; but to use `clause' labels for subordinate clauses. An example which 
			illustrates this division is 12:

			(12)  	[S [S The distinction at issue is relatively clear S] , but [S closer 
					examination reveals [CL that all is not quite so straightforward 
					[CL as it seems CL] CL] S] . S]
					
			Embedded (subordinate) clauses are generally identified by some sign of their 
			dependence on the superordinate clause or sentence, such as an introductory 
			conjunction or a non-finite verb form. It is noticeable that the coordinated 
			parts of the compound sentence do not have to be clause-like units with subjects 
			and verbs, and to this extent [CL] would be a misleading label to apply to them. 
			This is true, in 13, of so far so good in:

			(13)  	[S [S So far so good S] , but [S now consider gender in adjectives S] . S]

    <rdfs:comment>RRC (reduced relative clause)
Reduced relative clauses are adjoined to the NP they modify. 
(Bies et al. 1995)

We will use the term \reduced relative clause" to refer to participial or adjectival constituents of the
type illustrated in (@26).

(26) He bought two watches designed by Paloma Picasso.

Reduced relative clauses should be bracketed as adjunction structures. The structure of ( 26) is thus as in
(@27). Note that the reduced relative clause, which is headed by a participle, is bracketed as a VP.

			SubordinateClause is the class of clauses that cannot stand on their 
			own as sentences. A matrix clause combined with a subordinate clause 
			form a main clause. In the sentence 'John thinks that Mary is sick', 
			'Mary is sick' is the subordinate clause.
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/SubordinateClause)

			Dependent clauses (which are also sometimes referred to as subordinate 
			clauses) cannot stand alone as sentences. They usually begin with 
			subordinating conjunctions. A sentence with an independent clause and 
			any number of dependent clauses is referred to as a complex sentence. 
			One with two or more independent clauses and any number of dependent 
			clauses is referred to as a compound-complex sentence 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause, cf. 
			http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#subordinateClause).

			A subordinate clause is an embedded construction which contains a finite verb form.

    <rdfs:comment>A UnitOfAnnotation is a structural entity that can be annotated, e.g., a word, token, constituent, or another types of markable.
Word classes, etc., are then modelled as indirect children of UnitOfAnnotation. The division between Features and classes of UnitsOfAnnotation follows conventional standards.
