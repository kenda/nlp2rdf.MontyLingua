			The category adjunct (ADJ) is assigned to those constituents that appear as optional additions,

			In  \"John called Mary (from school) (with his cell phone)\"  the optional additions \"from school\" 
			and \"with his cell phone\" are such optional additions that can be left out freely.
			Adjuncts are generally used to convey additional information about the time, place, manner, or 
			cause of the event or situation described by the clause (see below). That is, they restrict the 
			class of events/  situations described by the clause to a subset. If required the category ADJ 
			can be split up into semantic sub-categories, that are annotated in layer semantic roles (time, 
			location, etc.).
