    <rdfs:comment>A UnitOfAnnotation is a structural entity that can be annotated, e.g., a word, token, constituent, or another types of markable.
Word classes, etc., are then modelled as indirect children of UnitOfAnnotation. The division between Features and classes of UnitsOfAnnotation follows conventional standards.

			Phrase is the class of syntactic constructions that consist of one or more 
			syntactic words, but lack the subject-predicate organization of a clause. 
			Phrases get their grammatical characteristics according to what word occupies 
			the head position; thus, all phrases have heads [Crystal 1980, 232-233; Pei 
			and Gaynor 1954, 169; Pike and Pike 1982, 453].

			At phrase level, the noun phrase is probably the least problematic of the categories to be dealt 
			with. In general, a noun phrase will a have noun or a pronoun as its head, and included within 
			the noun phrase are the determinative elements, any premodification, and any postmodification. 
			The examples below, 14 to 17 show noun phrases with the head noun/pronoun in bold:

			(14)  	[NP He NP] was a tiny man
			(15)  	[NP his white shirt cuffs NP]
			(16)  	[NP his surprisingly thick and hairy wrists NP]
			(17)  	[NP some wholly unanticipated but remotely possible event of absorbing interest NP]

			However, noun phrases may also occur with adjectival heads, as in 18 and 19:

			(18)  	[NP The unemployed NP] have had enough
			(19)  	We've beaten [NP the best NP]

			or with a head which is a cardinal or ordinal number, as in 20 and 21:

			(20)  	[NP The ninth NP] is my particular favourite
			(21)  	[NP The other seven NP] continued with the trip
			
			In `pro-drop' languages, such as Spanish and Italian, pronominal Subjects are usually not expressed. 
			Depending on the chosen type of analysis, this may require another definition of noun phrase, in order 
			to include `empty noun phrases', in which the pronoun is not actually present, but may be inferred 
			from the verb ending.

			A classic constituency test for Noun Phrases is that only whole NPs can be moved within the same sentence. 
			In English, constituents can be preposed to achieve some effect, as in 23 (from Radford 1988: 70):

			(22)  	I can't stand your elder sister
			(23)  	Your elder sister I can't stand (though your brother's OK).
			
			Examples 24 and 25 show that it is not possible to move only part of the NP:

			(24)  	*Your elder I can't stand sister
			(25)  	*Elder sister, I can't stand your

			However, this test should be used with caution. It works well in English, but not always in other languages. 
			For example, in 26 Neue Bücher is moved to the beginning of the sentence while keine is left at the end:

			(26) 	Neue	Bücher	habe	ich	keine
					new	books	have	I	no
					`I have not got any new books'
