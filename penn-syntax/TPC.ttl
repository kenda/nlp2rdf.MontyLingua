Fronted elements are those that appear before the subject in a declarative sentence. They are placed inside the top clause level (e.g. S, SINV, SQ, SBAR).  ...
Fronted arguments are attached under the main clause level. They always leave a *T* and are tagged -TPC. This holds whether the argument is fronted within a single clause or crosses more than one clause boundary.
