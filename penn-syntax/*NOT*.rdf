— anti-placeholder in template gapping
(Bies et al. 1995)

The term \gapping" refers to a form of coordination in which the coordinated phrases after the rst
are incomplete. For instance, the gapped equivalent of the full coordination structure in (@18a) is given in
( 18b).
( 18)
a. Mary likes Bach and Susan likes Beethoven.
b. Mary likes Bach and Susan, Beethoven.
Gapped sequences like Susan, Beethoven should be labelled X. On the other hand, while coordination

constructions containing gapped sequences involve coordination of unlike categories, it is clear that the
entire coordination structure is a clause; hence, it should be labelled S.
(Santorini 1991)

*NOT* is used in the template gapping procedure, along with “=” and a system of coindexation. See section 7 [Coordination] for more details on the template gapping approach.

Unlike other null elements, correspondence to a *NOT* is shown by an “=” index on the bracket label, rather than by a “–” index on the null element itself.

*NOT* is used very rarely (about 20 times in the entire WSJ corpus) when the “template” and “copy” are not entirely parallel. In principle, it can serve in two roles:


4.7.1  In the “copy”
In the copy, *NOT* can be used to indicate that the corresponding constituent in the template is not interpreted in the “copy”. 

  (S (NP-SBJ the auditor)
     (VP (VP (ADVP-TMP-2 first)
             described
             (NP-3 the old plan)
             (PP-CLR-4 as
                       (ADJP ill conceived))
             (PRN -LRB-
                  (SBAR-ADV-5 as
                              (S (NP-SBJ everyone)
                                 (ADVP-TMP already)
                                 (VP agreed)))
                  -RRB-))
         but
         (VP (ADVP-TMP=2 then)
             (NP=3 (NP the new plan)
                   (SBAR (WHNP-1 that)
                         (S (NP-SBJ we)
                            (VP 'd
                                (VP worked
                                    (ADVP-MNR so hard)
                                    (PP-CLR on
                                            (NP *T*-1)))))))
             (PP-CLR=4 as
                       (UCP (PP out (PP to (NP lunch)))
                            and
                            (ADJP totally half-baked)))
             (ADVP=5 *NOT*))))

Note that it is very difficult to construct a grammatical example, so (unsurprisingly) there are no actual examples of this construction in the WSJ corpus.


4.7.2  In the “template”
In the template, *NOT* appears in the position where the corresponding constituent in the copy is interpreted, when there is no matching constituent already in the template. 

  (S (NP-SBJ (NP The 189 Democrats)
             (SBAR (WHNP-1 who)
                   (S (NP-SBJ *T*-1)
                      (VP supported
                          (NP the override)
                          (NP-TMP yesterday)))))
     (VP compare
         (PP-CLR with
                 (NP (NP (NP-3 175)
                         (SBAR (WHNP-2 who)
                               (S (NP-SBJ *T*-2)
                                  (ADVP initially)
                                  (VP backed
                                      (NP the rape-and-incest exemption)
                                      (ADVP-TMP-4 (NP two weeks)
                                                  ago)
                                      (PP-5 *NOT*)))))
                     and
                     (NP (NP=3 136)
                         (NP-TMP=4 last year)
                         (PP=5 on
                               (NP a similar vote)))))))

More often than not, however, it is assumed that an unindexed constituent at top level of the “copy” is interpreted at highest possible level – usually VP-level of the template. (Note that this rule doesn't work in the above example, so it actually needs the *NOT*.)

So the following examples: 

  (S (NP The teacher)
     (VP (VP gave
             (NP-1 Ignatius)
             (NP-2 only a B)
             (SBAR-3 *NOT*))
         ,
         but
         (VP (NP=1 Bertha)
             (NP=2 an A)
             (SBAR-PRP=3 because
                         (S (NP-SBJ she)
                            (VP wrote
                                (ADVP-MNR so well)))))))


  (VP (VP increasing
          (PP-DIR-2 to
                    (NP 2.5 %))
          (PP-TMP-3 in
                    (NP February 1991))
          (ADVP-TMP-4 *NOT*))
      ,
      and
      (VP (PP-DIR=2 to
                    (NP 3 %))
          (PP-TMP=3 at
                    (NP six-month intervals))
          (ADVP-TMP=4 thereafter)))

might more likely be bracketed: 

  (S (NP The teacher)
     (VP (VP gave
             (NP-1 Ignatius)
             (NP-2 only a B))
         ,
         but
         (VP (NP=1 Bertha)
             (NP=2 an A)
             (SBAR-PRP because
                       (S (NP-SBJ she)
                          (VP wrote
                              (ADVP-MNR so well)))))))


  (VP (VP increasing
          (PP-DIR-2 to
                    (NP 2.5 %))
          (PP-TMP-3 in
                    (NP February 1991)))
      ,
      and
      (VP (PP-DIR=2 to
                    (NP 3 %))
          (PP-TMP=3 at
                    (NP six-month intervals))
          (ADVP-TMP thereafter)))

    <rdfs:comment>A UnitOfAnnotation is a structural entity that can be annotated, e.g., a word, token, constituent, or another types of markable.
Word classes, etc., are then modelled as indirect children of UnitOfAnnotation. The division between Features and classes of UnitsOfAnnotation follows conventional standards.
