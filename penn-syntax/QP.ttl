— Quantifier Phrase (i.e., complex measure/amount phrase); used within NP. (see section 11 [Modification of NP])  ...
This label is not used for NPs with quantificational determiners such as every, some, almost all, etc. Instead, it is used for multiword numerical expressions that occur within NP (and sometimes ADJP), where the QP corresponds frequently to some kind of complex determiner phrase.

The determiners a and an are included in the QP in cases where the appropriate interpretation is one: 

  (NP (QP under an) hour)

  (NP (QP less than a) year)
