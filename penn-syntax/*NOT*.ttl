constructions containing gapped sequences involve coordination of unlike categories, it is clear that the
entire coordination structure is a clause; hence, it should be labelled S.
(Santorini 1991)

*NOT* is used in the template gapping procedure, along with “=” and a system of coindexation. See section 7 [Coordination] for more details on the template gapping approach.

Unlike other null elements, correspondence to a *NOT* is shown by an “=” index on the bracket label, rather than by a “–” index on the null element itself.

*NOT* is used very rarely (about 20 times in the entire WSJ corpus) when the “template” and “copy” are not entirely parallel. In principle, it can serve in two roles:


4.7.1  In the “copy”
In the copy, *NOT* can be used to indicate that the corresponding constituent in the template is not interpreted in the “copy”. 

  (S (NP-SBJ the auditor)
     (VP (VP (ADVP-TMP-2 first)
             described
             (NP-3 the old plan)
             (PP-CLR-4 as
                       (ADJP ill conceived))
             (PRN -LRB-
                  (SBAR-ADV-5 as
                              (S (NP-SBJ everyone)
                                 (ADVP-TMP already)
                                 (VP agreed)))
                  -RRB-))
         but
         (VP (ADVP-TMP=2 then)
             (NP=3 (NP the new plan)
                   (SBAR (WHNP-1 that)
                         (S (NP-SBJ we)
                            (VP 'd
                                (VP worked
                                    (ADVP-MNR so hard)
                                    (PP-CLR on
                                            (NP *T*-1)))))))
             (PP-CLR=4 as
                       (UCP (PP out (PP to (NP lunch)))
                            and
                            (ADJP totally half-baked)))
             (ADVP=5 *NOT*))))

Note that it is very difficult to construct a grammatical example, so (unsurprisingly) there are no actual examples of this construction in the WSJ corpus.


4.7.2  In the “template”
In the template, *NOT* appears in the position where the corresponding constituent in the copy is interpreted, when there is no matching constituent already in the template. 

  (S (NP-SBJ (NP The 189 Democrats)
             (SBAR (WHNP-1 who)
                   (S (NP-SBJ *T*-1)
                      (VP supported
                          (NP the override)
                          (NP-TMP yesterday)))))
     (VP compare
         (PP-CLR with
                 (NP (NP (NP-3 175)
                         (SBAR (WHNP-2 who)
                               (S (NP-SBJ *T*-2)
                                  (ADVP initially)
                                  (VP backed
                                      (NP the rape-and-incest exemption)
                                      (ADVP-TMP-4 (NP two weeks)
                                                  ago)
                                      (PP-5 *NOT*)))))
                     and
                     (NP (NP=3 136)
                         (NP-TMP=4 last year)
                         (PP=5 on
                               (NP a similar vote)))))))

More often than not, however, it is assumed that an unindexed constituent at top level of the “copy” is interpreted at highest possible level – usually VP-level of the template. (Note that this rule doesn't work in the above example, so it actually needs the *NOT*.)

So the following examples: 

  (S (NP The teacher)
     (VP (VP gave
             (NP-1 Ignatius)
             (NP-2 only a B)
             (SBAR-3 *NOT*))
         ,
         but
         (VP (NP=1 Bertha)
             (NP=2 an A)
             (SBAR-PRP=3 because
                         (S (NP-SBJ she)
                            (VP wrote
                                (ADVP-MNR so well)))))))


  (VP (VP increasing
          (PP-DIR-2 to
                    (NP 2.5 %))
          (PP-TMP-3 in
                    (NP February 1991))
          (ADVP-TMP-4 *NOT*))
      ,
      and
      (VP (PP-DIR=2 to
                    (NP 3 %))
          (PP-TMP=3 at
                    (NP six-month intervals))
          (ADVP-TMP=4 thereafter)))

might more likely be bracketed: 

  (S (NP The teacher)
     (VP (VP gave
             (NP-1 Ignatius)
             (NP-2 only a B))
         ,
         but
         (VP (NP=1 Bertha)
             (NP=2 an A)
             (SBAR-PRP because
                       (S (NP-SBJ she)

      ,

          (PP-TMP=3 at
