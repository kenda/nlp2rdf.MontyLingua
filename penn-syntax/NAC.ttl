      rdfs:comment """NAC — Not A Constituent; used to show the scope of certain prenominal modifiers within a noun phrase.  ...
In the case where a noun is modified by an unshared modifier and also shares non-nominal premodifiers with another noun, the NX bracket label is used. That is, unshared items are lumped together with their respective noun heads and bracketed NX, with the shared modifier(s) outside NX (at NP level). The NX levels are then coordinated at the lowest level possible, as usual. 

NX brackets contain the head of the NP and its (unshared) modifiers in complicated NPs where both shared an unshared modifiers are involved. It 
does not correspond to any particular linguistic structure, although it occasionally resembles “N-bar”. Rather, it exists only to show which modifiers go with which NP head, and is only used when the extent of modification would not otherwise be clear. 

The NAC label, described in section 11 [Modification of NP], plays a similar role of indicating modifiers that go together. However, NAC is only used for pre-head modifiers, while NX always contains the head (or heads) of the NP in which it is found.
