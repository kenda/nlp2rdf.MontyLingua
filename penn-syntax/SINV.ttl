			Traditionally sentences are deemed to be composed of major constituents 
			known as clauses, which may be main clauses (not included in a superordinate 
			clause) or embedded clauses (included in a superordinate clause) such as 
			relative clauses or adverbial clauses. A main clause, unless it is coordinated, 
			is equivalent to a simple sentence, and does not need to be separately labelled. 
			Embedded and coordinated clauses, on the other hand, will need to be separately 
			identified. We recommend that such units be identified in the annotation, and 
			labelled either as sentences (S) or as clauses (CL), according to the preference 
			specified in the annotation scheme.

			The reason for allowing choice here is that different theoretical preferences 
			have to be accommodated. In some syntactic models, the `clause' category is not 
			used (except informally), embedded clauses being marked by included [S] 
			constituents. In other models, clauses are identified as such, even where they 
			are coextensive with an independent sentence.

			One solution which commends itself (and is employed in the Lancaster Treebank and 
			the SUSANNE Corpus) is to retain [S ... S] as the delimiter of sentences, whether 
			included or not, and also to use [S ... S] for the coordinated parts of a compound 
			sentence; but to use `clause' labels for subordinate clauses. An example which 
			illustrates this division is 12:

			(12)  	[S [S The distinction at issue is relatively clear S] , but [S closer 
					examination reveals [CL that all is not quite so straightforward 
					[CL as it seems CL] CL] S] . S]
					
			Embedded (subordinate) clauses are generally identified by some sign of their 
			dependence on the superordinate clause or sentence, such as an introductory 
			conjunction or a non-finite verb form. It is noticeable that the coordinated 
			parts of the compound sentence do not have to be clause-like units with subjects 
			and verbs, and to this extent [CL] would be a misleading label to apply to them. 
			This is true, in 13, of so far so good in:

			(13)  	[S [S So far so good S] , but [S now consider gender in adjectives S] . S]

			The maximal, syntactically independent, segments into which a text is subdivided, 
			for parsing purposes, are normally considered to be sentences. In a written text, 
			they are typically (though by no means invariably) delimited by an initial capital 
			letter and a final full stop (`.') or other terminal punctuation. It is convenient 
			to accept this primary orthographic definition of `sentence' for the purposes of 
			syntactic annotation. However, a sentence, so defined, may be either a full 
			sentence (9) or a `grammatically incomplete' one (10).

			(9)  	[S This is a sentence. S]
			(10)  	[S Well done. S]

			The same applies to sentences included within other sentences, as in (11)

			(11)  	[S [S ``Well done'', S] she said. S] }
			
			``Well done'' in 11 is labelled as a sentence, since it clearly has an independent 
			syntactic status equivalent to those of 9, even though it is included in another 
			sentence. This inclusion of one independent sentence within another is found both 
			with reported speech and elsewhere. Phenomena such as those illustrated in 10 are 
			by no means exceptional in text corpora.

			In transcriptions of spoken discourse, there is no simple answer to the question 
			``What is a sentence?''. Some transcriptions, based on standard orthography, yield 
			de facto sentences in the form of units beginning with a capital letter and closing 
			with a terminal punctuation mark. For these, there is no problem in recognising the 
			primary sentential segments and delimiting them by [S ... S], even though these 
			segments frequently lack the canonical structure of a complete written sentence. 
			Moreover, even in other transcriptions, where the standard orthographic practices of 
			sentence delimitation are avoided, it is possible to identify `primary segments' 
			analogous to the written sentence, viz. the primary units into which the transcribed 
			discourse is divided for parsing purposes. For spoken as well as written language, 
			then, the [S] unit may be retained, although it may be interpreted differently, and 
			some other term, such as `primary segment', may be preferred to `sentence'.

			We conclude by recommending, for the syntactic annotation of any text (including a 
			transcription of spoken language), an exhaustive division of the text into units 
			labelled [S ... S].
