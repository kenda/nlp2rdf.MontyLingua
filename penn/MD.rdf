		An auxiliary verb is a verb which accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase, 
		and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as 
		person, number, tense aspect, and voice. 
		(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnAuxiliaryVerb.htm 19.09.06)
		
		Besides modal verbs ("semiauxiliary") and "strict" auxiliary verbs, also copulas 
		are classified under auxiliary verbs here, as this is a praxis applied in practically every
		EAGLES-conformant morphosyntactic annotation scheme.

		Part of speech referring to the set of verbs, subordinate to the main lexical verb which help 
		to make distinction in mood, aspect, voice etc.

		SyntacticWord is the class of syntactic units occupying the lowest position in 
		a syntactic construction. They are the largest units resistant to insertion of 
		new constituents within their boundaries; or they are the smallest constituents 
		that can be moved within a sentence without making the sentence ungrammatical.
		(http://www.linguistics-ontology.org/gold/2008/SyntacticWord)
		
		Linguistic unit composed of at least a part of speech and a lemma.

			Verb form that is usually used with another verb to express ideas such as possibilities, permission, or intention.
            (Gil Francopoulo; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1329)
		
			A modal verb (also modal, modal auxiliary verb, modal auxiliary) is a type of auxiliary 
			verb that is used to indicate modality. The use of auxiliary verbs to express modality 
			is characteristic of Germanic languages.
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_verb 19.09.06)
			
			In addition to main and auxiliary verbs, it may be useful (e.g. in English) to recognise an intermediate 
			category of semi-auxiliary for such verbs as be going to, have got to, ought to.
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/annotate/node18.html#oav1v 20.09.06)
			
			The auxiliaries in English subdivide into the primary verbs `be', `have', and `do', which can also function 
			as main verbs, and the modal auxiliaries such as `can', `will', and `would', which are uninflected, and always 
			function as auxiliaries.

		A verb is a part of speech that usually denotes action ("bring", "read"), 
		occurrence ("decompose", "glitter"), or a state of being ("exist", "stand"). 
		Depending on the language, a verb may vary in form according to many factors, 
		possibly including its tense, aspect, mood and voice. It may also agree with 
		the person, gender, and/or number of some of its arguments (subject, object, etc.).
