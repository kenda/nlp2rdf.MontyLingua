			The comparative is the form of an adjective or adverb which denotes 
			the degree or grade by which a person, thing, or other entity has a 
			property or quality greater or less in extent than that of another. 
			In English the structure of a comparative consists normally of the 
			positive form of the adjective or adverb, plus the suffix -er, or 
			(especially in the case of longer words) the modifier \"more\" (or 
			\"less\") before the adjective or adverb. The form is usually completed 
			by \"than\" and the noun which is being compared, e.g. \"he is taller 
			than his father is\", or \"the village is less picturesque than the 
			town near by is\". (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative  17.11.06)
