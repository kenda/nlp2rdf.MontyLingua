			Verb form that is usually used with another verb to express ideas such as possibilities, permission, or intention.

			A modal verb (also modal, modal auxiliary verb, modal auxiliary) is a type of auxiliary 
			verb that is used to indicate modality. The use of auxiliary verbs to express modality 
			is characteristic of Germanic languages.
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_verb 19.09.06)
			
			In addition to main and auxiliary verbs, it may be useful (e.g. in English) to recognise an intermediate 
			category of semi-auxiliary for such verbs as be going to, have got to, ought to.

			The auxiliaries in English subdivide into the primary verbs `be', `have', and `do', which can also function 
			as main verbs, and the modal auxiliaries such as `can', `will', and `would', which are uninflected, and always 
			function as auxiliaries.
